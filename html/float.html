            A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing
            a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about 
            paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is 
            a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one 
            central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a 
            time to your broader argument.
